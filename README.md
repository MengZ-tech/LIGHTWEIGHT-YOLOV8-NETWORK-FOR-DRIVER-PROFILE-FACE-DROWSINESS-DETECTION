##Lightweight YOLOv8 Networks for Driver Profile Face Drowsiness Detection
This case uses a lightweight improved version of YOLOv8-Pose for training a detector with five key points on side faces, aimed at achieving high-frame-rate fatigue detection for drivers. The data is derived from the re-annotation of side face images in the CFP dataset.

In this repository, you can find the annotation files, images, pre-trained weight files, and configuration files used for the lightweight improvement of the network structure.
